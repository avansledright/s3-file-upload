# s3-file-upload
S3 File Upload is a simple project that I have been working on to automate the backup of my local NAS.
Yes there are plenty of tools that I could have already used to build this but I wanted to make my own.

USAGE:
Edit the Dockerfile to include the required arguments or, you can simply run main.py with the following arguements:
main.py API_KEY API_SECRET DIR BUCKETNAME
